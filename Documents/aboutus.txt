This project entitled as "kharidbikri.com Online Buying and Selling System" is a system with main functionality to buy and sell products online. Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or services from a seller over the Internet using a web browser. 
This system is specially meant for the buying and selling of used goods thus it can also be considered as an online second hand market. The basic concept of buying and selling used items online is to allow sellers or merchants to place their ads on sale or services to be afforded by them. These ads can be seen by the other users and if they want to buy anything that is shown in the ads, they can contact the buyers. The vendor can post a 'for sale' ad for their used products.
